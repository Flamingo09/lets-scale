Any system has basically these components:
```
1. Database
2. Caching
3. Delegation - Things which are not needed in real time should be done asynchronously
4. Concurrency
5. Scaling
6. Communication
```

1. Database Redundancy \
    -> Stand By \
    -> 1:1 \
    -> N:N
    
2. Storage Redundancy \
    -> RAID
    -> Geo Redundancy \
    -> Datacenter Redundancy
    
3. Serverless architecture
